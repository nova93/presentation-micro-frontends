<h1 class="fancy-highlight"><span>The New Way</span></h1>

<ul>
  <li><p>Start defining User Experiences in a device agnostic way</p></li>
  <li><p>User Experience and it's BFF owned by a single team</p></li>
  <li><p>Look for common functionality across the business, build a single micro-service for all to use</p></li>
  <li><p>Don't repeat yourself, build once, use many times</p></li>
  <li><p>Keep BFFs and micro-services contextual, don't be afraid of spinning a new service (we have tools to make that painless)</p></li>
  <li><p>Shameless plug: use `create-oodle-app`</p></li>
</ul>
