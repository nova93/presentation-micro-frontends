# Micro-frontends

Micro-frontends are to the front end what micro-services are to the backend: small, maintainable parts of a puzzle, organized by the problem that they solve and owned by one team. The opposite of a micro-frontends architecture is a front end monolith.

### What are the benefits?

Like with micro-services, if you can do them right:

- they can be changed and deployed independently
- the micro-frontends are kept smaller and simpler, making them more maintainable and easier to test
- teams can own a particular feature and become domain knowledge experts on that feature
- ideally, they can even be using different tech stacks. This means that we can tailor our technical decisions to the requirements of a particular problem, or incrementally change to a new stack one micro-frontend at a time if necessary.
