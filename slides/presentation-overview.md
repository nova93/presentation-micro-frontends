<!--
I'll start off with a quick look at the way we used to do things, some of which is still kicking around.

Then, I'll give an overview of micro-frontends, backend-for-frontend and micro-services.

With that shared understanding, I'll showcase the new process and the new architecture we are moving towards.
And finally, I'll end with a look into the future.
