# Micro-service

Micro-services help build an application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and are independently deployable. These services may be written in different programming languages and may use different data storage techniques. This results in the development of systems that are scalable and flexible.

### What are the benefits?

- Simpler to understand
- Reusable across the business (DRY)
- Evolutionary (good for complex systems which are changing)
- Quicker feature implementation
- Language/infrastructure agnostic
